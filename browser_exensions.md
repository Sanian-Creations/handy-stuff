| Extension                        | Description |
| -------------------------------- | ----------- |
| uBlock origin                    | Ad blocker  |
| CanvasBlocker                    | Blocks fingerprinting methods pages use to track you. |
| ClearURLs                        | Removes stupid unnecessary query parameters from your urls |
| ViolentMonkey                    | Userscript manager |
| Stylus                           | Userstyle Manager |
| I still don't care about cookies | Cookie-popup blocker (does not work on all sites, but most so it's still nice) |
| User Agent Switcher              | Does is it says. Only really necessary for some sites which require you to use a specific browser. |
